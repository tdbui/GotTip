# Pre-work - *GotTip*

**GotTip** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Tuan Bui**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

## Notes

This is my first iOS app ever and also the first time I attempted to use a Mac.  My first struggle is to figure out how to use persistence storage to preserve data across app restart, then it was how to implement locale setting, and last was to figure out how to change the color theme of the app.  I learned so much and had so much fun building the app.
